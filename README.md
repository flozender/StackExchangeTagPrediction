# Stack Exchange Question Tag Assignment
#### SOEN 471/SOEN 6111 - Big Data

## Project Definition
Thousands of questions are asked on Stack Exchange everyday, which makes navigating through the vast collection of questions difficult. Question tagging is a feature that helps categorize a question broadly, in an attempt of grouping questions of similar topics or fields together. The goal of our project is to appropriately predict these tags for questions that were asked by users of [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com).

### Dataset and Characteristics

### Research Questions
One of the more pertinent questions that we will have to answer will be related to the approach we use in trying to make the predictions. Will a model designed around producing predictions based on the frequency of the appearance of certain words be sufficient, or will the extraction of some type of 'meaning' from the combination of words using more sphisticated models be necessary in developing predictions that are adequately useful?
This will answered by comparing models developed using both methods. Which model is more effective? Which model was more difficult to develop and train? Are the tradeoffs worth it? All of these questions will need to be answered before deciding on the model to use for our project. Another important question that is related to the feasibility of our project as a whole is how often people use tags in their stack exchange posts. This will directly affect the possible size of our training sets, and thus the plausibility of developing an effective model.
